<h1>Every one of us should become a vegetarian beause eating meat can cause serious health problems.</h1>

<h2>AGREE</h2>
<p>First of all, the first reason to be a vegetarian is because of meat-related diseases. <br> For example, many studies have shown that red meat is especially bad, and consumption should be limited to eating only a few times a week to avoid cancer.<br>  Meat is also associated with health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes because it can be high in saturated fat.<br>  Second, the biggest cause of the earth's environmental pollution is cattle livestock. The amount of methane gas from cow manure actually has a great effect on the atmosphere.</p>

<h2>DISAGREE</h2>
<p>I strongly believe that not everyone needs to be vegetarian. The first reason is that we are designed to eat meat as human beings, <br> suggesting that eating meat is not harmful to health, and we have been eating meat for thousands of years. <br> For example, primitive people made hunting tools to kill animals and eat meat. Second, meat is a rich source of protein that helps build muscles and bones.</p>
