<h1>Every one of us should become a vegetarian beause eating meat can cause serious health problems.</h1>

<p>AGREE<br>First of all, the first reason to be a vegetarian is because of meat-related diseases. For example, many studies have shown that red meat is especially bad, and consumption should be limited to eating only a few times a week to avoid cancer. Meat is also associated with health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes because it can be high in saturated fat. Second, the biggest cause of the earth's environmental pollution is cattle livestock. The amount of methane gas from cow manure actually has a great effect on the atmosphere.</p>


<p>DISAGREE<br> I strongly believe that not everyone needs to be vegetarian. The first reason is that we are designed to eat meat as human beings, suggesting that eating meat is not harmful to health, and we have been eating meat for thousands of years. For example, primitive people made hunting tools to kill animals and eat meat. Second, meat is a rich source of protein that helps build muscles and bones.</p>
